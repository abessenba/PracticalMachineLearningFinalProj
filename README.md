This project was submitted on 7/2/2017 

The purpose of the Practical Machine Learning Course project is to predict the manner in which a group of 6 healthy subjects completed one set of 10 repititions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different ways (A-E). The ‘Classe’ variable represents the five different ways to complete the exercise, with A being correct and B-E being alternate incorrect ways to complete the exercise. More details on the data and the data itself can be found at the HAR website http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.
